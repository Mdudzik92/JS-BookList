<!-- Explanation of what the app is -->

This app is written in object oriented style using ES6 classes. Interacting with Local storage using events, the user can input a book's title, author, and isbn to create a list of books listed in a table below. An alert lets them know if they haven't filled in all fields, and a separate alert lets them know if they've successfully added or removed a book from the list.
